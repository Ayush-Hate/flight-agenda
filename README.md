An implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm and the Example in the page: http://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs2321/www/newLectures/30_More_Dijkstra.htm

(as stated in http://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs2321/www/newLectures/30_More_Dijkstra.htm):

A travel agent requests software for making an agenda of flights for clients. The agent has access to a data base with all airports and flights. Besides the flight number, origin airport and destination, the flights have departure and arrival time. Specifically the agent wants to determine the earliest arrival time for the destination given an origin airport and start time.
